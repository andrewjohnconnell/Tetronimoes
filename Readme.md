#Tetronimoes
A small, single play-through, implementation of Tetronimoes in Java using Swing.
## How to play
Tried to keep this nice and simple (and a little old school)...

A: Move Left

D: Move Right

W: Turn clockwise

S: Speed Drop

P: Pause

## Credits
Taylors of Harrogate, for the sublime coffee that's kept me awake while writing this one up.
